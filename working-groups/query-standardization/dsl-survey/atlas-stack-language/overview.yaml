      - title: Consolidation
        description: >
          Atlas processes and stores data at pre-configured and fixed intervals rather
          than at individual timestamps. All queries must use the default or include
          a valid "step" size that determines the interval window of each value returned
          from a query. The majority of data is stored at a 60 second step (at Netflix).
          
          Wider query time ranges automatically increase the step size to reduce the
          number of data points in a graph or output. Users can choose custom step
          sizes at regular multiples of the base step size. The default consolidation function 
          is chosen based on the aggregation function used in the expression. In general 
          we want the consolidation function and aggregation function to be associative so 
          that we can choose whether to perform consolidation or aggregation first. There 
          are overrides if that is not true, e.g. using max consolidation with sum aggregation, 
          but then we have to delay consolidation until all aggregation is complete to 
          avoid incorrect results.

          However, the consolidation behavior does vary based on the type for average. 
          When doing an average consolidation for counters intervals with no data will 
          be treated a 0 and included in the count for the denominator of the average. 
          This is because they typically represent no activity for that interval and it gives 
          a correct rate across the consolidated interval. For gauges the intervals with 
          no data are ignored and do not contribute to the count. This avoids reducing 
          something like a temperature reading with 0 values that wouldn't actually be possible.

      - title: Default Aggregation
        description: >
          Data matching the predicate is aggregated via `sum` by default. Groupings must
          be applied to drill down into individual time series.

inspirations:
  - RRDTool

description: >
  An RPN-style stack based DSL for the open source Atlas metrics system from Netflix. 
  The design was meant to ease transition from an RRDtool based system to a more 
  flexible, dimension based distributed store. A rich syntax allows for simple single 
  line filtering, grouping and aggregation of metrics while also supporting complex 
  data analysis. The DSL includes presentation aspects as the API is capable of 
  generating PNG graph images for storing and sharing similar to the previous RRDtool.

designCallouts:
  - title: URI friendly
    description: >
      During a production incident, users want to share graphs with each other quickly
      and via various methods. Including the entire query in a URI means that any 
      technology (email, messaging, text, etc) can quickly and easily pass the relevant
      data on to others. Recipients can then modify the query without affecting other
      users. Extracting the query and using it in other tools is simple as well.

  - title: Reusability
    description: >
      Coinciding with the goal of being URI friendly, the language does not include
      a time range in the grammar. Rather the time is supplied via URI so that the
      same query can be saved in a dashboard, alert or other source and various times
      applied without having to re-write the query.
      
      Query templates can also be extended with the addition of filters (`:cq`) and
      grouping (`:cg`) without modifying the original basis.

  - title: Ease of Aggregating Multiple Metrics
    description: >
      The DSL does not require a user to select a metric name before executing a 
      query. Instead, the metric is considered another dimension so the same grammar
      that applies to filtering dimensions applies to the metrics as well. This 
      allows for quick aggregation of multiple metrics.

  - title: Presentation Grammar
    description: >
      Since ASL is focused on generating visualizations, it made sense to incorporate
      presentation operators in the grammar so users could generate a graph to their
      liking in a portable query.

  - title: Backend Vs. Streaming Queries
    description: >
      Most ASL with a few exceptions like offset and filters can be executed against a 
      backend store or in a streaming context. This allows us to schedule most queries 
      where we want for things like alerts and the user typically doesn't need to worry 
      about which context it is running in.

  - title: Operator Categorization
    description: >
      For ASL we categorize the operations, roughly into choosing, aggregation, math, 
      presentation (CAMP). Some contexts like queries on metadata to project the set 
      of keys or values for a given key just support the choosing category. For data 
      queries choosing/aggregation can be pushed to the data layer and be distributed 
      similar to basic map/reduce operations. The math operations are also broken up 
      into basic, stateful, and filters depending on what is needed for an operations. 
      For example, stateful operations keep history and would put restrictions on the 
      execution order of the expression if partitioning computation across time.

caveats:
  - title: RPN and Stack
    description: >
      Reverse Polish Notation and stack languages are very simple to parse and implement
      but difficult for end users to understand. However it does allow for easy extensibility
      without modifying the core syntax.

  - title: Lack of Query Scope
    description: >
      Because a metric is not specifically required to execute a query, a vast amount
      of data may wind up matching the given predicate. In turn, such a query may
      consume an inordinate amount of resources or confuse users with the data
      retrieved. The query engine implements a number of restrictions that require
      users to scope their predicates to a smaller set.
