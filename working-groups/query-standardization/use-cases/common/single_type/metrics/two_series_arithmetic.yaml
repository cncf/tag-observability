title: Two Series Arithmetic

description: >
  A common operation operation involves combining two or more time series into a single
  aggregate. Used most often in systems that require a single explicit metric name 
  during query time with optional filters on tags. 

inputs:
  - metric series

uses:
  - type: Alerting
    description: >
      Used for simple, single threshold alerting on a combination of series. 

  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Compute averages or ratios, e.g. average latency or percentage of failed requests.

example_description: >
  Selects two time series, `http_requests_errors` and `http_requests_success`,
  filtering both where the tag `handler` has the value `/api/comments`, then
  adding the results

examples:
  - language: PromQL
    query: >
      sum(http_requests_errors{handler="/api/comments"}) + 
      sum(http_requests_success{handler="/api/comments"})
