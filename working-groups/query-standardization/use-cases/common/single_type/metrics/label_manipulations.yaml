title: Label Manipulations

description: >
  A common operation operation involves joining, extracting, or replacing
  existing label values.

inputs:
  - metrics series

uses:
  - title: Actioning
    description: >
      Commonly used as an intermediary to simplify operations on the resulting 
      metric set, for eg., creating "default" sets of label values, manipulating
      labels only for the set of metrics that match the given vector, etc.

  - title: Visualization
    description: >
      Commonly used to create visualizations where relations involving 
      aggregated data are concerned.

contexts:
  streaming: true
  real_time: true
  batch: true

example_description: > 
  The example below shows that for all metrics with empty `foo` and `bar` label
  values, `foo` will assume the value of `otherFoo`. Futhermore, `bar` will be 
  set to `zero` for resulting set of metrics that have an empty `bar` label 
  value.

examples:
  - language: PromQL

      label_replace(
        label_join(
          metric{foo="", bar=""},
          "foo", 
          "",
          "otherFoo"
        ),
        "bar",
        "0",
        "bar",
        ""
