title: Selection and Group By with Aggregation

description: >
  The most common query for metrics is to select a subset of time series, group
  the series based on the unique values for a tag or dimension and aggregate the
  results into a single value for each unit of time.

inputs:
  - metrics

outputs:
  - title: Alerting
    description: >
      Commonly used when each group has similar behavior and the same static threshold
      can apply to all groups.

  - title: Visualization
    description: >
      Typically plotted in line graphs where patterns can be extracted to determine if
      various groups of groups have similar behaviors or if one or more group exhibit
      outlying behavior.

example_description: > 
  Computes the sum of the metric `http_requests_total` where the tag `handler`
  has the value `/api/comments` for every unique `job`.

examples:
  - language: PromQL
    query: >
      sum by (job) (
        http_requests_total{handler="/api/comments"}
      )

      TODO - example using a traditional RBDMS where the timestamp is a column
      and the step needs to be computed. That gets ugly
    caveats:
      - > 
        With ANSI SQL and a traditional RBDMS you must specify a time range and a
        bucketing function to aggregate values for multiple timestamps within a 
        consolidation window.

      metric http_requests_total
