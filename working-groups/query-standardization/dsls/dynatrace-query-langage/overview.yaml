paradigms:
  - pipeline
  - declarative

supportedTelemetryTypes:
  - type: metrics
    description:
      Metrics is targeting all the data stored in a timeseries database .
      That includes the core dynatrace metrics collected by the various dynatrace component, the data ingest through the metric
      ingest api or the OpenTelemetry metric ingest api
    callouts:
      - title: Aggregation
        description: >
        DQL on timeseries provides several aggregation func:
          - avg
          - max
          - min
          - sum
       Every aggregation function can be combined with the command "by" that will split the metric into one or several dimensions ( labels)

      - title: Various operator
        description: >
        DQL allow the enduser to  :
        - filter: the operator will filter the metric by applying a condition on the value
        - from, to : those operator can filter the extraction of the metric on a specific timeframe
        - interval : allow us to change the granularity of the data.
        - timeframe: creates a timeframe structure from the given start and end timestamps.

      - title: metric dimensions
        description: >
          all the other signals ( event, traces, logs...) requires to fetch data to a specific data source
          fetch logs
          timeseries is the specific term to retrieve data stored in the timeseries format.

  - type: traces, logs, events, bizents, smartscape
    description:
      - spans is targeting all the data representing a distributed trace.
        That includes the dynatrace traces ( named purepath) collected by the oneagent,and the data ingest through the OpenTelemetry ingest api
      - logs correspond to log data collected by the oneagent or sent to the log ingest api or the opentelemetry logs apî
      - events corresponds to all the events collected by the Dynatrace components ( such as the kubernetes events) , but it also include any
        send to the events api of dynatrace
      - bizzvents is a dynatrace concept created to create event business events from data present in http request ( header, payload, url parameters...Etc). the purpose of
        bizz events is to keep track of a business flow of a given application or platform. the bizzevents are mainly created by the oneagent, but it is also possible to
        ingest external bizz events with the api
      - smartscape is a specific dynatrace concept to collect data on the dependency map.
      - dynatrace entities to collect object reference of dynatrace entities

      - title: Various operator
        description: >
        DQL allow the enduser to:
          - filter: the operator will filter the metric by applying a condition on one or several keys of the data
          - parse: parse provide the option to parse the content of the data( logs) , you parse specific keys and convert them into new
            attributes that can be used later in the pipeline as filter , or aggreation
          - fields: the query can add extra keys to the data, remove keys to reduce the data, rename..etc
          - lookup: lookup is powerful feature where the query can start creating a JOIN to another datatype.
          - summarize: create aggreagation to generate a metric or dashboard out of the data

inspirations:
  - TODO

description:
  A DQL query contains at least one or more commands ( fetch, filter, limit, parse,data, fields,summarize, lookup ...) each of
  which returns tabular output containing records (lines or rows) and fields (columns).
  All commands are sequenced by a | (pipe). The data flows or is funneled from one command to the next.

  - goal: Reusability
    description: >
      Coinciding with the goal of being URI friendly, the language does not include
      a time range in the grammar. Rather the time is supplied via URI so that the
      same query can be saved in a dashboard, alert or other source and various times
      applied without having to re-write the query.
