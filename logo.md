| Observability is a diverse approach to the visibility of a system’s health metrics based on its architecture. This diversity in metrics collection and proactive analysis of historical system health assists in pinpointing system weaknesses and failures. It is the ears used to locate problems within the environments we manage. | Many owl species have asymmetrical ears. When located at different heights on the owl’s head, their ears are able to pinpoint the location of sounds in multiple dimensions. ![](https://i.imgur.com/zqHpkUq.jpg) |

**Data Ingestion and Analysis**

|  | |
| -------- | -------- |
|  Observability's goal is to provide a 360-degree view of a system's health using a collection of resources and tools. This powers the decision making informed by data, fact, observed & verifiable reality.        |     Owls can rotate their necks 270 degrees. A blood-pooling system collects blood to power their brains and eyes when neck movement cuts off circulation. ![](https://i.imgur.com/vbREc6J.png)    |

**Multi-faceted Skillset**

|  | |
| -------- | -------- |
| This discipline exists at the intersection of many others. Where other engineering approaches are siloed, observability calls on skills from systems resilience, software, and even hardware engineering to understand a system’s health through the entire stack. Sometimes situations require us to pivot on one or more of these skills to solve the business problem. | Owls are zygodactyl, which means their feet have two forward-facing toes and two backward-facing toes. Unlike most other zygodactyl birds, however, owls can pivot one of their back toes forward to help them grip and walk.     |
